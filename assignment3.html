    <p class="para">The Taj Mahal is an immense ivory-white marble mausoleum located on the south bank of the Yamuna River in Agra, India. Built by the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his favorite wife, Mumtaz Mahal, it is recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage site and is widely considered one of the most beautiful buildings in the world. 
History
A monument of love: Construction of the Taj Mahal was commissioned by Emperor Shah Jahan in 1631 after the death of his beloved wife, Mumtaz Mahal, who passed away while giving birth to their 14th child.
Construction: The project, led by architect Ustad Ahmad Lahouri, employed over 20,000 artisans and laborers. Construction of the main mausoleum was finished around 1648, while the surrounding buildings and gardens were completed by 1653.
A golden age of architecture: The Taj Mahal is regarded as the pinnacle of Mughal architecture, an artistic style that blended Persian, Islamic, and Indian influences.
Shah Jahan's later years: Following the completion of the Taj Mahal, Shah Jahan was deposed and placed under house arrest by his son Aurangzeb. He spent his final years gazing at the Taj Mahal from the Agra Fort. 
Architecture and design
The Taj Mahal complex is a marvel of Mughal design, with several key features: 
Mausoleum: The centerpiece is the tomb of Mumtaz Mahal, and later, Shah Jahan himself. The mausoleum is constructed of white marble and features a large central dome surrounded by four smaller domes.
Symmetry and balance: The entire complex, including its gardens and surrounding buildings, is renowned for its perfect symmetry.
Intricate details: The marble surfaces are meticulously decorated with intricate floral carvings and pietra dura, a type of inlay work using thousands of semi-precious stones.
Gateway, mosque, and jawab: The complex is accessed through a magnificent red sandstone gateway. A mosque is located on the west side of the mausoleum.The Taj Mahal is an immense ivory-white marble mausoleum located on the south bank of the Yamuna River in Agra, India.
